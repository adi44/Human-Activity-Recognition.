# Human-Activity-Recognition.


Human Activity Recogonition Using Smartphones

Human Activity Recogonition. it has huge number of applications, in several fields like human survey system and medical research. in this project you will design a robust activity recogonition system based on the smartphones. As you know mobile devices have accelerometer as the sensor which collects the activities. All these activities kan be calssivied using 4 different methods of machine learning. some of them are Support Vector Machine, K-nearest neighbour, quadratic classifier and many more. Also you need to use several active learning algorithms that will reduce the data labelling expense.

# Data Set

https://www.kaggle.com/uciml/human-activity-recognition-with-smartphones

it is under license CCO.
and it is by UCI machine learning.

## Associated tasks   
            -here you need to train your dataset and create a model. this model can be used to trest the dataset. you can use n numbers of algorithms for classifications.
            -once you find the accuracy you need to make a normalised and non normalised confusion matrix and plot it using pyplot.

  ## Dataset characteristics
	
human activity recognition Dataset contains, several coloums, various coloumns in dataset.
## Dataset characteristics
	
For each record in the dataset the following is provided:

   	 
      	
	
	
	
	A 561-feature vector with time and frequency domain variables.
    	Its activity label.
	Triaxial Angular velocity using gyroscope
   	An identifier of the subject who carried out the experiment.
	Triaxial acceleration from the accelerometer (total acceleration) and the estimated body acceleration.
